### Compiling Still Hungry
Our code structure and workflow is VERY heavily based off the one used by [Pahimar](https://github.com/pahimar) in his [Equivalent Exchange 3](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3) project (huge thanks to him, this mod would never have got finished without the help I got from looking at his code) - the compilation instructions shown [here](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3/blob/master/README.md) will work for our mod too, and are probably better explained than anything I could write out at this time in the morning.
